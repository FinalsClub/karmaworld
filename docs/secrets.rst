Storing Secrets
===============

Secrets are things that we have to specify to our app,
but do not want to check into source control.
These are stored as files in `karmaworld/karmaworld/secrets`


client_secrets.json
-------------------

`client_secrets.json` is the api drive authentication with google api services for authenticating the server-side of `gdrive.py` requests. It is generated by google and used in `gdrive.py`.


db_settings.py
--------------

`db_settings.py` stores data about the production database.

+ PROD_DB_NAME = "" # is the database name in postgres
+ PROD_DB_USERNAME = "" # is the postgres login username
+ PROD_DB_PASSWORD = "" # is the postgres login user password


drive.py
--------

`drive.py` specifies the google drive user that we are uploading documents too.

+ GOOGLE_USER = "" # a google drive email address that we authenticate with

static_s3.py
------------

`static_s3.py` sets up variables in `settings/prod.py` for AWS S3 static file storage. 

+ DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage'
+ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = ''
+ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = ''
+ AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = '' # this will differ between production and beta
+ S3_URL = 'http://%s.s3.amazonaws.com/' % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
+ STATIC_URL = S3_URL
